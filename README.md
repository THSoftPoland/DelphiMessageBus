# DelphiMessageBus
<b>MessageBus for Delphi</b> (known as Event Bus too)

You should read about Message Bus (Event Bus) idea. 
In short - in some place in your application, you should send Message (Event). In other places you can receive this Message.
My proposal is based on named messages (not on definition on class). Its very handy: you can receive same Class on diferent way.
